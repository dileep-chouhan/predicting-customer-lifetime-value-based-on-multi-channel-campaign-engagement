# Predicting Customer Lifetime Value Based on Multi-Channel Campaign Engagement

**Overview:**

This project analyzes the effectiveness of multi-channel marketing campaigns in predicting customer lifetime value (CLTV).  The analysis identifies the most impactful marketing channels and customer segments, providing insights for optimizing future campaign ROI.  The project leverages statistical modeling and data visualization to uncover key relationships between customer engagement across various channels (e.g., email, social media, paid advertising) and their subsequent CLTV.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

**Example Output:**

The script will print key findings to the console, including summary statistics, model performance metrics (e.g., R-squared, RMSE), and insights into the relative importance of different marketing channels.  Additionally, the project generates several visualization files (e.g., `customer_segmentation.png`, `cltv_prediction.png`) in the `output` directory, illustrating the relationships between customer characteristics, channel engagement, and CLTV.  These visualizations provide a clear visual representation of the analysis results.


**Data:**

The project requires a dataset containing customer information, including their engagement with various marketing channels and their corresponding CLTV.  A sample dataset is not included in this repository; please provide your own dataset in the specified format (detailed in the `data` directory, if applicable) before running the script.
